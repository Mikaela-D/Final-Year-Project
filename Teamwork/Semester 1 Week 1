This week, I haven't got a team yet. Most people have not decided what type of project they want to do, so I am unsure who to team up with.
The teamwork I did this week was to give Parthib feedback about his project idea. I thought it was a good idea with intermediate difficulty.
I also asked my supervisor about his opinion of my project idea. He told me to research to find out if my project idea is possible.
