What I want to do this week:

	1. Fully setup my VS code
	2. Confirm which technologies I want to use in my project
	3. Have the project proposal nearly finished
	4. Try using open AI API
	5. Test how I would host my project on hugging face


Technologies:
	• IDE: VS Code
	• Frontend: Vue.js, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
	• Backend: Node.js with Express.js
	• Database: 
	• AI Integration: OpenAI API for AI features
	• Python Environment: Anaconda ((if I add custom AI in the future)
	• Deployment: AWS Amplify
	• Unit Testing: Vitest
	• Version Control: GitHub
	• Authentication: AWS Amplify Authentication or Firebase (recommended for simplicity)


UPDATE: I HAVE CHANGED PROJECT IDEA. I NO LONGER WANT TO MAKE AN AI-POWERED FULL-STACK LEARNING PLATFORM.

I want to make a company driven project based on the work I do at Genesys. The project will be an AI-Powered Call Centre Platform.


I don't know if I want to use firebase or AWS, and I don't know if I will host the project or not.

Research:
