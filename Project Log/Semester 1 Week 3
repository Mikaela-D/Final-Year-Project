This week I didn't attend ATU because I was sick with the flu. I did some teamwork anyway with Parthib. I gave him feedback on his new project idea and 
how to improve his architecture diagram, and I showed him my project proposal. He will give me feedback about the proposal on Monday. 

What I worked on last week: last week I worked on the project proposal and architecture diagram. I also set up some parts of the project on VS code.
What I am working on this week:  This week I have slightly changed my project idea to be a company driven project instead of making it separated from 
the work I do at Genesys.
Blockers: None.
