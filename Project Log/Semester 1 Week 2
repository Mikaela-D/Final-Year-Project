What I want to do this week:
* Start the project architecture diagram
* Make the project idea more specific with defined steps and defined technologies
* Discuss project development with my supervisor Brian and Michelle

What I have done this week:
* Set up the project locally on my machine using VS Code. 
* Installed necessary extensions such as Node.js, node_modules


Steps to develop the project:
1. Define project scope
2. Set Up Development Environment (VS Code, Node.js, Vue.js, Python, Git, and the database)
3. Design Application Architecture (Architecture Diagram)
4. Build backend (Node.js + Express.js)
5. Develop frontend
6. Integrate user authentication
7. Train the AI model
8. Connect frontend and backend
9. Add unit tests using Vitest
10. Deploy the project
11. Polish the UI
12. Add documentation
13. End to end testing to find any bugs


Next to do: 
* How to run the project
* Try AWS amplify
