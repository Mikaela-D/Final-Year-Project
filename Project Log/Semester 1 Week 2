What I want to do this week: 

* Start the project architecture diagram 

* Make the project idea more specific with defined steps and defined technologies 

* Discuss project development with my supervisor Brian, and Michelle 
  

What I have done this week: 

 Set up the project locally on my machine using VS Code.  

 Installed necessary extensions such as Node.js, node_modules 

 Brian's advice (use AWS in the second semester because it will be covered in class in the second semester) 
  

Steps to develop the project: 

1. Define project scope 

2. Set Up Development Environment (VS Code, Node.js, Vue.js, Python environment, Git) 

3. Design Application Architecture (Architecture Diagram) 

7. Train the AI model 

5. Develop frontend 

4. Build backend (Node.js + Express.js) 

6. Setup the database 

6. Integrate user authentication 

8. Connect frontend and backend 

9. Add unit tests using Vitest 

10. Deploy the project 

11. Polish the UI 

12. Add documentation 

13. End-to-end testing to find any bugs 

  

More specific than last week: 
  

Key features of the project: 

  * Courses on HTML, CSS, JavaScript 

  * AI learning material (sections) 

  * AI quizzes 

  * AI chat 

  * Log in 

  * Learning feedback 

  * Learning path recommendations  

  * Learning tracking 

  * AI coding exercises 

  

Technologies: 

  * IDE: VS code 

  * Frontend: Vue.js, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Typescript, Pinia 

  * Backend: Node.js with Express.js 

  * Database: Amplify Data storage or MongoDB or PostgreSQL or MySQL 

  * AI Model: Python machine learning (eg. TensorFlow, PyTorch)  

Python environment: Anaconda  

  * Deployment: AWS Amplify 

  * Unit testing: Vitest 

  * Version control: GitHub 

  * Authentication: AWS amplify authentication or FIREBASE (recommended by Brian for its simplicity) 
 

What I want to do before Thursday: 

Fully setup my VS code 

SETUP VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT FOR PYTHON AND CALCULATE HOW MUCH I WILL GET DONE BEFORE XMAS. Which way to train the AI? Reinforcement learning or datasets? (PAUL'S ADVICE) Note. I think it is better to use datasets. 

Confirm which technologies I want to use in my project 

Basic architecture diagram 

Download a hugging face project from GitHub and try it in hugging face (Brian's feedback) 

 

Idea: 

Do something in my project that chatGPT can't do, such as humanizing text, but it seems ok to simply use chatGPT for my project without creating my own AI. 

To create a unique AI, I could train an AI model that explains code in progressively simpler or more complex ways based on a student's progress. 

 

Questions: 

What will I demo in Xmas? 

Datasets or reinforcement learning for the AI? 

Use existing AI or train my own? 

 


Update: I have changed my mind about my project. I will start my project by using open AI API, then in the future, I might create my own AI. 

 

Updated steps: 
 

Define Project Scope 

Set Up Development Environment 

Design Application Architecture 

Set Up OpenAI API 

Integrate OpenAI API 

Develop Frontend 

Build Backend 

Set Up Database 

Integrate User Authentication 

Connect Frontend and Backend 

Add Unit Tests 

Deployment 

Polish the UI 

Add Documentation 

End-to-End Testing 

 

Updated Technologies: 

IDE: VS Code 

Frontend: Vue.js, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Pinia  

Backend: Node.js with Express.js 

Database:  

AI Integration: OpenAI API for AI features 

Python Environment: Anaconda ((if I add custom AI in the future) 

Deployment: AWS Amplify 

Unit Testing: Vitest 

Version Control: GitHub 

Authentication: AWS Amplify Authentication or Firebase (recommended for simplicity) 

 

What I want to do before next week:  

Try using open AI API. 

 

Researched websites: 

https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/ 

https://aws.amazon.com/free/?all-free-tier.sort-by=item.additionalFields.SortRank&all-free-tier.sort-order=asc&awsf.Free%20Tier%20Types=*all&awsf.Free%20Tier%20Categories=*all 

Researched where to find datasets to train the AI: https://github.com/search?q=javascript%20dataset&type=repositories 

https://www.kaggle.com/search?q=javascript 

Followed this tutorial to learn how to integrate the open AI API into my project: How To Build Your Own AI With ChatGPT API 

Authentication: https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth
